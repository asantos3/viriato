#### Notes

* Viriato is a fork of the [monokai syntax theme](https://atom.io/themes/monokai) and was based on [monokai-extended](https://atom.io/themes/monokai-extended) and [atom-monokai](https://atom.io/packages/atom-monokai).
* The colors were based on the [KDE Human Interface Guidelines](https://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Usability/HIG/Color).
